# covid_deaths_and_vaccinations

Exploring COVID data using SQL and creating a Covid deaths and infection rate dashboard.

In this project, I complete two main tasks:

- Separated COVID data from ourworldindata into two files: COVID deaths and COVID Vaccinations and explored the features of the two data sets.
- Using the data to create a Tableau interactive dashboard with four graphs: Global statistics, Total Deaths per Continent, Percent Population infected per Country, Projected Percent Population Infected.
- Here is the link to the Tableau dashboard: https://tabsoft.co/3QBRbuZ
